OpenBSD-BSPWM-Utterly-Nord-DOTFILES

IMPORTANT !!!! : This bspwm configuration supports dual monitor if you have two monitors use xrandr to find the names of your displays and update it . If you don't have dual monitor just delete the monitor name and the second line . 
   Also remove from lxqt session settings the screen layout and be sure to copy the go-picom script this could save some problems.
   
   IMPORTANT !! INSTALL FISH you don't have to make it default but install it anyway because sxhkd shortcuts uses it to launch alacritty terminal
   
   You can install kvantum on OpenBSD from git with information you can find on the internet.
 
 --Dependencies to install:
